# Contributing to this repository

This repository is intended to be community driven, and as so contributing is made as simple as possible. No coding style or commit formatting requirements are applied to community-supplied extensions, it is up to the owner of each extension to decide. Issues can be filed against any extension but it's up to the author/owner of that extension to respond to issues or approve pull requests on their extensions.

## Code of Conduct

I want to ensure that anyone can be free to contribute and feel welcome in the community. For that reason the project has adopted the same [contributor covenent](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as RenderDoc as a code of conduct to be enforced for anyone involved in this repository. This includes any comments on issues or any public discussion in related places such as any RenderDoc spaces - e.g. the #renderdoc IRC channel or discord server.

If you have any queries or concerns in this regard you can get in touch with me [directly over email](mailto:baldurk@baldurk.org).

## Acceptable extensions

RenderDoc is a tool intended for debugging your own projects and programs, those to which you have true ownership of. Use and abuse of RenderDoc for illegal or unethical uses including but not limited to capturing copyrighted programs that you do not own the rights to will not be tolerated. This means any extensions related to exporting data, or capturing programs will not be accepted.

## Copyright / Contributor License Agreement

Any code you submit will remain copyright to yourself, and it's recommended that you have a copyright header on your source files or a LICENSE file in your subdirectory clarifying your copyright ownership. For simplicity of management and to foster an open community your code must be licensed under the [MIT license](../LICENSE.md). You can of course still write extensions that are not licensed this way, but they would not be eligible for inclusion in this repository.
